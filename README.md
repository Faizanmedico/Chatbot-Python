✅ How to Run
Install Flask:

pip install flask
Run the server:

python app.py
Open your browser: Go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/

Would you like to make the bot smarter using ChatGPT or something else later?

You said:
yes, I like it!
ChatGPT said:
Awesome! 🎉 I'm glad you liked it, Sultan!

Now, since you're interested in making the chatbot smarter using ChatGPT, you can upgrade it by connecting it to the OpenAI API. Here's how to do that.👇




🔐 Step 1: Get Your OpenAI API Key
Go to https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

Create an API key and copy it (keep it private).

⚙️ Step 2: Install the OpenAI Python Library
pip install openai
🧠 Update chatbot_logic.py to Use ChatGPT
# chatbot_logic.py
import openai
import os

# Replace with your actual API key or use environment variables
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")  # safer option

def get_response(user_input):
    try:
        response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
            model="gpt-3.5-turbo",  # or "gpt-4" if you have access
            messages=[
                {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
                {"role": "user", "content": user_input}
            ]
        )
        return response.choices[0].message["content"].strip()
    except Exception as e:
        return "Oops! Something went wrong."
🔒 Step 3: Set Your API Key Securely
You can set your key as an environment variable:

On Linux/macOS:

export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
On Windows (CMD):

set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
Now restart your Flask app:

python app.py
Visit http://127.0.0.1:5000 again — now your chatbot is powered by ChatGPT! 🚀

✅ Solution: Create the Proper Folder Structure
Flask expects HTML files to be inside a folder named templates (by default).

🔧 Steps to Fix
In your project folder (where app.py is), create a folder called:

templates
Move your index.html file into that templates folder:

chatbot/
│
├── app.py
├── chatbot_logic.py
├── templates/
│   └── index.html ✅
├── static/
│   └── style.css
✅ Verify in Code
Your folder must look like this, and in your app.py file this should match:

@app.route('/')
def index():
    return render_template('index.html')  # Looks inside /templates
Once you move index.html to the templates folder, save all files, restart Flask:

python app.py
Then open http://127.0.0.1:5000 again — it should now work fine!






✅ 1. Check That You Have Set the API Key
Since you're using:

openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
Make sure you’ve set your environment variable before running app.py.

Linux/macOS:
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
python app.py
Windows CMD:
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
python app.py
Or for temporary testing, just set it directly in chatbot_logic.py (not recommended for production):

openai.api_key = "sk-xxxx-your-api-key-here"
✅ 2. Add Logging to See the Real Error
Update chatbot_logic.py to print the real error:

def get_response(user_input):
    try:
        response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
            model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
            messages=[
                {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
                {"role": "user", "content": user_input}
            ]
        )
        return response.choices[0].message["content"].strip()
    except Exception as e:
        print("Error:", e)  # 🛠️ Add this line
        return "Oops! Something went wrong."
Then run your Flask app from the terminal, enter a message, and check the terminal output to see the actual error message.

✅ 3. Verify openai Is Installed
Make sure the library is installed in your virtual environment:

pip install openai
✅ 4. Common Errors & Fixes
Error Message in Terminal	Fix
InvalidRequestError: This model is not available	Use a correct model like "gpt-3.5-turbo"
Unauthorized: You must provide an API key	Your API key isn’t set correctly
openai.error.RateLimitError	You've hit the usage limit — wait or upgrade your plan
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'openai'	You forgot to pip install openai
